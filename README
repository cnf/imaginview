ImaginView is a php class to build a photo gallery. 
It's small, simple, and easy to implement.

1. Introduction

ImaginView was written because the gallery scripts I found on the net where in
either of 3 categories:
1) not "scripts" at all, but rather just templates. you had to create the 
	thumbnails yourself.

2) Bloated. Don't get me wrong, galleries such as coppermine are nice, just WAY
	overkill for what I needed.

3) Crap.

So I decided to write something to fill the gap. The result was ImaginView.
It aims to provide the basics of a gallery script, and do it well. Imaginview
has no admin section, no upload, no comment system, (although I plan to include
a sceleton "admin" page in the package for reference) it just creates and caches
thumbnails for images in a recursive directory structure.

ImaginView is 100% template based, so you don't need to edit the class to change
the look of your gallery. It uses a header and a footer file to allow for easy 
integration into your existing site.
